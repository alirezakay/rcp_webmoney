## WEBMONEY

Webmoney is something like PayPal. please visit their site at: \
https://www.wmtransfer.com/

You can see and congigure your **purses** after creating a personal/merchant account here: \
https://merchant.wmtransfer.com/conf/purses.asp

<br>

In this URL, click on setting tab:

There are probably two purses in the list:

- WMX-purse: A bitcoin-based purse that its ID starts with X

- WMZ-purse: A dollar-based purse (USD) that its ID starts with Z

So it is important you know that you **cannot** set the **currency-type** in the payment requesting-form. \
Actually you should add the **purse-id** to the request-form. each purse is a representative of the currency-type.

For changing the options and fields of each purse, click on the *change* button on the right side of the rows.

2. You should definitely set the **secret key**. this field is used for verification of the payment after receiving the response-form from the webmoney gateway (required)

3. Enable the option: **Let to use URL sent in form**.  (required)

4. Enable the option: **Send notification to Result URL in case of payment error** (optional)

5. Set the **Control sign forming method** to `SHA256`. (required). This is very important; this plugin uses the *sha256* hash method.
